# Transcriptomics

## 10-8-2024 DESeq

We started a new unit on transcriptomics, beginning to compare the trascripts of Copepods grown at different temperatures when exposed to varying temperatures.

Developmental plasticity: same genes, different environment -\> different phenotypes

Experimental Questions: How do animals acclimate?: Physiological mechanisms of developmental plasticity: 1. Does the temp that they experience growing up effect UGT?, 2. How does gene expression response differ btwn temps? 3. What genes are expressed during development?

Factors: Development (levels = 18 degrees and 22 degrees C) and Final Temperature (levels = Control, 28, and 33 degrees C)
